0x08. C - Recursion
by Mduduzi Nzama
When a function calls itself, it creates a new instance of the function on the stack, and each instance has its own set of variables and parameters. The function keeps calling itself until a specified base condition is met, at which point the recursive calls stop, and the function starts returning values from the deepest call stack back to the initial call.
